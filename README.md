## Overview
This Rust program implements polynomial factorization using the Rational Root Theorem. It evaluates the possible rational roots of a polynomial and determines the actual roots.

## Features

- Computes the divisors of a given integer.
- Evaluates a polynomial at a specific value.
- Identifies and returns the rational roots of the polynomial.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone Polynomial_Factorization_in_Rust_Using_Rational_Root_Theorem.git
   cd Polynomial_Factorization_in_Rust_Using_Rational_Root_Theorem
