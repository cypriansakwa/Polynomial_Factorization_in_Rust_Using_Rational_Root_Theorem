## Overview
This Rust program implements polynomial factorization using the Rational Root Theorem. It evaluates the possible rational roots of a polynomial and determines the actual roots.

## Features

- Computes the divisors of a given integer.
- Evaluates a polynomial at a specific value.
- Identifies and returns the rational roots of the polynomial.

## Example
- Given the polynomial $x^3-6x^2+11x-6$:
>```
>let polynomial = vec![1, -6, 11, -6]; // x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6

- The program evaluates possible rational roots and prints the results. If no rational roots are found, it will indicate so.
## Requirements
- Rust installed on your machine. (If Rust is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it).
